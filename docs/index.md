## Getting Started

Read the [Getting Started tutorial](./getting-started.md).

## Config

- This plugin is configured with the `app` object in your config.
- `app.type` should be set to `aws-beanstalk` so Meteor Up knows this plugin will deploy and manage the app.
- You will need to add `mup-aws-beanstalk` to the `plugins` array in your config
- The `servers` object is not needed

Example config:

```js
module.exports = {
    app: {
        type: 'aws-beanstalk',
        // Must be at least 4 characters
        name: 'app-name',
        path: '../',
        auth: {
            // IAM user's Access key ID
            id: '12345',
            // IAM user's Secret access key
            secret: '6789'
        },
        env: {
            ROOT_URL: 'http://website.com',
            MONGO_URL: 'mongodb://user:pass@domain.com'
        },
        // (required) Minimum number of servers running your app
        minInstances: 2,
        // (optional, default is minInstances) Maximum number of servers
        // for autoscale to scale up to
        maxInstances: 5
    },
    plugins: ['mup-aws-beanstalk']
}
```

Complete example:
```js
module.exports = {
    app: {
        type: 'aws-beanstalk',
        // Must be at least 4 characters
        name: 'app-name',
        path: '../',
        auth: {
            // IAM user's Access key ID
            id: '12345',
            // IAM user's Secret access key
            secret: '6789'
        },
        env: {
            ROOT_URL: 'http://website.com',
            MONGO_URL: 'mongodb://user:pass@domain.com'
        },

        // (required) Minimum number of servers running your app
        minInstances: 2,
        // (optional, default is inInstances) Maximum number of servers
        // for autoscale to scale up to
        maxInstances: 5,

        // (optional, default is t2.micro) Type of instance to use
        instanceType: 't2.small',

        // (optional) Array of domains to request an ssl certificate for

        forceSSL: true,

        // (optional) If no DNS-Server is set, the default VPC's DNS-Server is used
        // This is needed for the resolver within the Nginx-config
        dnsServers: ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'],

        // (optional) Adjust HTTP-headers where needed. Except for the contentSecurityPolicy,
        // the settings are already adjusted for improved security.
        httpHeaders: {
            strictTransportSecurity: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload',
            xFrameOptions: 'DENY',
            xContentTypeOptions: 'nosniff',
            xXssProtection: '1; mode=block',
            xRobotsTag: 'none',
            contentSecurityPolicy: 'default-src \'self\' \'unsafe-inline\' https: wss:;'

            'giflib-devel': ''
        },

        // (Optional) Send a SIGTERM signal to the app instances 30 seconds before they will be shut down.
        gracefulShutdown: true,

        // (optional) Same options as when deploying with mup.
        // The one difference is serverOnly now defaults to true
        buildOptions: {
            // Default is true
            serverOnly: true,
            debug: false,
            buildLocation: '../../build',
            mobileSettings: {},
            server: 'http://app.com',

            executable: 'meteor'
        },

        // (optional) Override or add options in the beanstalk config
        // this plugin creates.You can customize any option on:

        customBeanstalkConfig: [
            {
                namespace: 'aws:autoscaling:asg',
                option: 'Cooldown',
                value: '300'
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: ['mup-aws-beanstalk']
}
```

Changes to `yumPackages`, `forceSSL`, `dnsServer`, `httpHeaders` and `buildOptions` requires deploying a new version to take affect.

## Cost

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is free, but you do pay for the services it uses, including:

- EC2 Instances. By default, it uses `t2.micro`, which costs $8.50/month($0.012 / hour). While the Beanstalk environment is updating, or a new version is being deployed, 25% additional servers will be used.
- Application Load Balancer. Pricing details are at https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/
- S3. 3 - 4 app bundles are stored on s3. Each deploy will make 2 list requests and upload 1 file. Beanstalk might store additional files on s3.

Graceful Shutdown uses the following services:
- Cloud Trail. The trail is stored in s3 and, according to their docs, usually costs less than $3 / month.

## Rolling Deploys

When deploying a new version, there is no downtime, and the number of servers handling requests is not reduced.

Beanstalk is configured to use Rolling updates with additional batch with a batch size of 25%. This means that Beanstalk first creates an additional 25% instances and deploys the new version of the app to them. After the app has started, it will update the remaining servers in batches of 25%, except for the last 25%, which it terminates.

This does not apply when changing the instance type. Instead, Beanstalk terminates the instances and replaces them in batches of 1/3 (rounded to the nearest integer). If you only have one server, there will be downtime until the app is running on the new server. Before changing `instanceType`, increase `minInstances` to at least 2 and run `mup reconfig` to avoid downtime.

## Load balancing

Load balancing is automatically configured and supports web sockets and sticky sessions.

## Scale
To scale your app, modify `app.minInstances` in your mup config to how many servers you want your app deployed to. Then run `mup reconfig`.

You cannot scale to 0 servers. Instead, use `mup stop`.

AWS limits how many instances your account can have. To increase the limit, you will need to contact their customer support. Learn more [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/manage-service-limits/).

## Autoscaling

To enable autoscaling, make sure that `app.maxInstances` in your mup config is greater than `app.minInstances`.

After modifying `app.maxInstances` or `app.minInstances`, run `mup reconfig`.

The average cpu for the previous 5 minutes is used to trigger autoscaling. When the average is above 75%, it will be scaled up, and an average below 35% scales down.

## Enhanced Health

Enhanced health is enabled for your app. No metrics are configured to be stored in CloudWatch.

You can view the health by running `mup beanstalk status` or on the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home).

## Logs

The log commands shows the last 100 lines. You can download a zip file with all of the logs from the [aws console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home).

## Meteor and Node versions

This plugin supports meteor 1.2 or newer. It will automatically use the correct Node and npm version.

## SSL

This plugin can request a certificate for you using the [Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/).

In your config, add:

```js
module.exports = {
    app: {
        // ... rest of config

        // Enables SSL. Array of domain names to create the certificate for.
        sslDomains: [
            'website.com',
            'www.website.com',
            'website.net'
        ],

        // (optional) Redirect http to https
        forceSSL: true
    }
};
```

Then run `mup deploy` or `mup beanstalk ssl`.

The command will show a list of email addresses that ACM sent an email to with instructions on verifying the domain name. The list includes your domain's registrant, and administrative and technical contact, as well as a few common addresses.

After you have followed the instructions in the email, run `mup beanstalk ssl` to configure Beanstalk to use the certificate.

You can also run `mup beanstalk ssl` to view the certificate's status or to resend the confirmation email.

ACM automatically renews the certificates.

## Graceful Shutdown

This plugin can setup CloudWatch Events to send a `SIGTERM` signal to your app on instances that are being drained by the load balancer. Your app can listen for this signal and gradually disconnect users or do other work needed before shutting down. The signal is sent at least 30 seconds before before the load balancer finishes draining it. 

Before enabling this feature, make sure the IAM user has these policies:

- `IAMFullAccess`
- `AWSCloudTrailFullAccess`
- `CloudWatchEventsFullAccess`

Next, install the [@meteorjs/ddp-graceful-shutdown](https://github.com/meteor/ddp-graceful-shutdown) npm package and add this code to your app's server:

```ts
import { DDPGracefulShutdown } from '@meteorjs/ddp-graceful-shutdown';
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';

new DDPGracefulShutdown({
  gracePeriodMillis: 1000 * process.env.METEOR_SIGTERM_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS,
  server: Meteor.server,
}).installSIGTERMHandler();
```
`METEOR_SIGTERM_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS` is set to 30 seconds.

In your config, set `app.gracefulShutdown` to `true`:
```js
module.exports = {
    app: {
        // ... rest of config

        gracefulShutdown: true
    }
};
```

Then run `mup deploy`.

You can now replace the policies you added with their read only equivilents: `AWSCloudTrailReadOnlyAccess`, `CloudWatchEventsReadOnlyAccess`, and `IAMReadOnlyAccess`.


## Troubleshooting

- View the logs with `mup logs` or from the AWS Console
- View the environment events with `mup beanstalk events`
- Check the app and instance's health with `mup beanstalk health`
